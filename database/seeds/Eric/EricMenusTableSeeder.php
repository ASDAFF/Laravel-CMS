Has your household income tripled in the last 18 years? Utility rates have sky rocketed in the last 18 years. In 2001, PG&E had 2 tiers, and the most expensive summer time rate was 13.3 cents per kWh. In 2018, that top tier is 40.3 cents for the same E1 rate. That means it’s tripled in 18 years. Solar, on the other hand, has dropped in cost. When we started installing solar in 2004, the average cost $9.00 per kWh. Today it’s less than half that, plus the government will pay a 30% tax credit!

Solar will save you money every month. Many homeowners are shocked at the $20,000 price tag of solar but. what they fail to realize, after a tax credit of $6,000 and financing that remaining $14,000, you’ll save money every month by going solar. Guess what happens when rates increase, you save more money! Going solar means you get to lock in your energy costs and the massive rate hikes stop!

The average homeowner has a cash system paid for in 7 years. That means, instead of paying the utility for the next 7 years, you recouped your solar investment. Beyond that, installing solar is a clear statement, “I’m not willing to burn fossil fuels, even ‘natural gas’. I want clean renewable energy. I want to leave a better world for the next generation. I believe in doing my part.” What will your legacy be? Go solar, save money, leave a legacy. 

Why did you stop renting and buy a house? Stop renting energy, invest into your future, not the utilities, buy solar. You made a smart choice to buy a house, so why is the thought of adding a system with no moving parts so scary? Your kitchen takes way more abuse, yet you aren’t afraid to own those granite counter tops. There are many ways to get solar. You can buy it straight out, but many finance it! The finance payment is nearly always the same or lower than what you currently are paying.

By adding solar to your professional office space, you can charge more per foot. We’ve successfully seen multiple companies offer Gross Leases or Full Service Leases which increase profits even more. This keeps it simple for the tenant, and you get to charge more. Going solar means you make even more money.

Successful business is about getting others to work towards a goal and producing unstoppable momentum. Why not make the roof work just as hard, by installing solar. Many businesses pay massive electric bills and never even think twice. Every business owner knows that drastically reducing energy is a smart move.

We can install a kiosk in your lobby, or on your website, showing everyone how much CO2 you are offsetting or trees you’ve equivalently planted. There are huge marketing forces associated with better energy. Show your customers you are a leader, and they should choose you! 

Set yourself apart from your competition. Your competitive advantage should start with not wasting energy. You wouldn’t want your employees taking advantage of you by wasting time. Why let the utility take advantage of you, and sell you power at a higher cost than needed? Energy is the most basic commodity that exists. Selling an electron doesn’t get any more basic. So why the utility upsell you, when you can lower your costs and still be connected to the grid. Employees love to know they work for a company that has solar. It makes them feel proud of where they work. Empower your employees with the knowledge their company has solar.  

By making the financially wise decision to go solar, your business will also gain the reputation of making environmentally-conscious decisions, encouraging a positive image to your employees and customers. Let’s keep our environment clean and green for future generations to enjoy.

PV is a developing field and utilizes several different technologies: monocrystalline (single crystal), polycrystalline (multiple crystal), cadmium telluride, gallium arsenide, or amorphous silicon deposited as a thin film. The major advantage of monocrystalline cells is their higher efficiency and therefore smaller space requirements. Thin film can be cheaper to manufacture but is significantly less efficient, requiring more area which results in more labor, mounting hardware, and bottom-line costs.

PV solar panels are usually either roof-mounted or ground-mounted. On a rooftop, rows of panels (called arrays) are mounted to face south or southwest at or near a 30 degree angle for maximum efficiency. The PV solar panels are fastened onto aluminum racks which are then secured to the roof framing, providing sufficient support for the array. This same array layout can also be mounted on the ground if the property has large, usable ground space.

Pole mounts are also a popular system, especially in more rural areas. The panels are generally mounted on the top of the pole but can also be mounted onto the side. Top-pole mounts require a steel pole about 12 feet in length set in concrete. These systems may include an auto-tracking feature which will automatically adjust the angle of the panels to follow the sun’s progress throughout the day.

Eventually, that poorly terminated wire will start to generate heat. This heat has melted down connectors, burned wiring boxes down, and even the back side of modules. There are documented cases of these types of issues burning down buildings.

Other issues range from improperly electrically grounded systems, to modules flying off the roof. We have unfortunately been called out to multiple sites, where the previous installation company was clearly in a rush and didn’t properly secure the modules. Typically a solar module is mounted to your home or business, so that it can sustain hurricane force winds.

So how does more adding solar panels to an existing system work?

This all depends on how big your inverter is. If your system was oversized to accommodate adding to it, your inverter should be big enough to handle generating a little more power. If your inverter is too small to handle additional panels, you’ll need to have a larger capacity inverter installed along with the new panels.

Also, be space-conscious. More panels means you’ll need more available space, either on your roof or on the ground.

A couple of things to keep in mind…

The first thing you should do when considering adding to your system is to contact the solar contractor that installed your solar panels originally and discuss with them upgrade options and what your goals are. This is an important step to remember since you can possibly void your system warranty if you hire another contractor to add to your existing system. If the original solar contractor is no longer in business, you should try contacting the manufacturer of your system and ask them to refer a local installer who can help you.

Mixing and matching components from different brands can be done if needed, as long as the voltage is compatible and can be balanced properly.

Right after washing them, customers often see a 10% increase in production so you will absolutely benefit from regular cleanings.

What to do? Well cleaned and maintained items always last longer. Soap and water or a vinegar solution works just fine for your average debris and dirt covered panel, maybe using rubbing alcohol for any particularly tough spots. But be warned, sometimes certain soaps leave a solar panel clean but too shiny, which reflects the sunlight instead of absorbing it!

Naturally they want to verify that their system is working correctly. How can you know how your system is performing before something bad happens? 

– Is your system on track monthly?

A good install company should explain & provide monitoring of your system’s performance on a monthly basis. A glance at a smart phone app once a month tells you all you need to know. Many customers want to see the instant output of a PV system to determine system performance, but this is unrealistic. Such data requires specialized equipment, which few install companies have. SynergyPower has this apparatus- We can conduct such a test on a clear day at a time when your panels have full sun (no shade).

– Is your monitoring reporting any errors?

Nearly all PV solar systems today have free monitoring systems. The easiest way to access many of these is to install the app on your smart phone and keep a weekly to monthly eye on it. If it reports an error, contact the installer. Or call us! We can help resolve the issue. 

– Have trees shaded your solar since you installed?

Tree growth is often overlooked as culprit for your solar underperforming over time. Installers may assume trees will not grow and/or you’ll keep them trimmed. There are even laws in some states ensuring your ‘right to sun access’ once you install solar on your roof, including from neighbors’ trees. Regardless of views on that legislation, it is a factor that’s often overlooked. Few people want to pay for a system inspection only to find out they need to pay someone else to trim their trees in order to restore system performance. 

– How does your monthly utility bill look?

If you are on an annual net metering agreement (NEM) with your utility, expect to create a credit in the summer and likely the opposite in the winter. This assumes your system is designed to eliminate your bill and not just reduce it. Keeping an eye on that monthly utility statement is a great way to make sure you don’t get hit with a massive bill at the end of the solar anniversary.  

– Is the inverter on?

Many systems have an inverter with a green light indicating that all is well. Check your manual or send us a picture of yours if you have any questions. Of course, many other systems have AC modules or inverters under each panel, a good reason to keep that monitoring active and supervised. 

– Are the panels dirty?

While some dirt is normal, if your solar panels are very dirty (or these days, covered with ash), it may be practical to clean them. Our trained technicians clean the panels and perform a basic check to ensure the system is working. They can also recommend a more thorough inspection and explain why it may be warranted. Avoid window cleaners that dismiss the difference between solar panels and window glass, as they may use soap that can leave residue that reflects, rather than absorbs sunlight. SynergyPower has solar panel cleaing experts on staff.

A few things to keep in mind regarding system inspections. 

– What exactly is being checked?

You want to make sure you know what exactly is being verified, and what type of documentation you’ll receive. Synergy Power provides a 28 point check list with photo documentation. 

– What testing standards will be used?

We test to the MCS and IEC 642446 standards. This means your system will be tested to ensure safe and proper operation. You can learn more about these standards here.

Costs can increase due to accessibility. If your system is mounted on a carport, that can often increase the complexity and time required for proper testing. Expect to pay more for difficult access situations. 

If you are getting your system inspected, it’s also a good time to consider getting it cleaned. Since you’ll have technicians on site, it’s a great time to save a truck roll and get those modules cleaned.

Also, some fuels such as coal and oil require mining, drilling, and fracking, which can leave the land stripped of plants and trees along with a whole other list of major issues that are harmful.

On the other hand, the sun is a natural power source and solar panels are able to easily capture clean sunlight that can be turned into useable power. No burning or toxic gases needed! The more people switch their homes and businesses to run on solar power, the less fossil fuels are needed. Which is good since eventually the supply will run out, whereas solar and other renewable sources will be there when we need them.

Couple net metering advantages with the federal solar tax credit that allows 30% of the whole photovoltaicsystem cost to be claimed as a tax credit, not a deduction, until it is used up. Any size solar system is eligible for this incentive as of 2018, but with politicians and utility companies constantly fighting incentives, and the tax credit set to drop to 20% starting in January 2020, now is the time to take advantage of what is currently offered.

From there, we determine how much a suitable solar system will cost before and after-tax incentives.

If you are eligible for a zero down solar system installation deal, we will help you obtain that financing as well. We also show you your likely payback period, break-even point, and when you can expect a return on your investment.

Solar systems typically add a minimum of $15,000.00 to the value of your home, which we encourage you to verify with your realtor.

In contrast, solar rates have dropped significantly since 2004.

The initial price tag for a solar panel system may seem high, but ultimately you save money every month by going solar, and you lock in your energy costs because there are no more energy cost hikes. Most customers can go solar by paying a small deposit and then replacing the monthly payment to the utility company with a cheaper payment to the solar finance company. You literally save money every month by going solar.

Roof type: Asphalt shingles – tile and rubber membrane do not cost extra, but shake, slate or 100-year-old clay tile may make solar panel installation a bit more expensive.
Roof age:5 to 10 years old is ideal. Once the solar panel installers have placed the solar tiles on top of the roof, they will last a long, long time. Therefore, a solar system installation is often combined with a new roof. We work with a number of roofers, which makes going solar and getting a new roof very easy.
Roof orientation:Due south is great, as is a western orientation, but anywhere between east-southeast and west is satisfactory. We are even seeing panels placed north on a roof. While you may face a slight loss in energy compared to other directions, it’s still better than renting from the utility. We can provide detailed analysis for every roof location.
Roof shade:You are looking for none at all, or very little. Shade kills the output of solar panels if they are traditionally wired, as shade on even a small portion of one panel can reduce output of a whole string of panels.We use micro inverters or optimizers on all our systems to overcome shade challenges. SolarEdge, one of our main product suppliers, is 99% CEC (California Energy Commission) rated efficient. This greatly helps any shading your roof may have. Winter and morning shade is not really as large as a concern as summer shade. Get a detailed analysis of your home solar today.

Over much of the last decade, California has led the way in the remarkable growth of the US solar market, with PV 16,200 megawatts of installed solar as of October 31, 2017.

As of mid-2017, the average price for solar panels for companies and homes in Livermore was $3.85 per watt, compared to $9.00 in 2004. The typical residential system size in the United States is 5 kilowatts (5,000 watts), making the average cost of a solar energy system in Livermore around $17,300 before any rebates or incentives, which impact the Return on Investment (ROI) over the life of your system.

In fact, the average solar panel system in Livermore cost around $12,000 in 2017, after rebates and before factoring in ROI incentives. This is, in part, due to the 30% rebate offered to both residential and commercial installations. These costs can seem scary, when you don’t compare them to what the utility company is charging. Homeowners are lulled into paying a monthly bill and not realizing they have nothing to show for it. Going solar replaces the utility bill and puts money into your home.

It is small, and generally produces about 1 to 2 watts of power.  These cells are connected to form larger units that are then connected to an electrical grid to form a complete PV system. Because solar energy systems are modular, they can be built to meet both large and small electric power needs.

Made of different semiconductor materials, PV cells come in many sizes and shapes ranging from smaller than a postage stamp to several inches in width. To withstand outdoor elements for many years, these cells are sandwiched between protective materials.

PV modules and arrays a part of a larger system that includes mounting structures and components that convert direct current (DC) electricity to alternating current (AC) current, powering the electrical needs of your home or business.

As a turnkey designer and installer of PV solar roof panels, Synergy Power ensures that all your solar system needs are taken care of for your solar panel roof installation, solar panel maintenance, and solar panel repair.

                                'content' => 'There are numerous benefits to hiring a solar energy company to power your home. These benefits include:

Financial Savings: Regardless of changing political stances, the fact is that growing global demand for solar power panels has spurred manufacturing and supply chain updates that have seen the cost of solar power drop significantly in many parts of the United States. Another incentive is that solar panel systems add as much as 20% in value to your home. This will increase as conventional electrical rates continue to escalate because solar systems stabilize your utility costs.
Sustainability: Solar energy is generated from the sun and is renewable. In addition, solar energy does not require water to operate, which means it does not have a significant impact on water systems the way that fossil fuels do.
Security: Solar-powered systems are less prone to large-scale failure or blackouts since a disruption of a system in one place does not cut off power to an entire region. In fact, a solar power panels are inherently secure when combined with micro-grids.
Job Creation: According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, “in 2011 the US solar industry employed approximately 100,000 people either full or part time.” This number topped over 300,000 in 2017 with close to 78% of jobs associated with solar panel systems being in installation, sales, and project development while 15% are in manufacturing. This upward trend has been interrupted in 2018 by the imposition of tariffs on solar-related items coming into the United States, but that is seen as temporary.
Peak Power: Usage has been causing brownouts and blackouts in certain parts of the country when power cycles fluctuate, and demand and supply do not match. Traditional solar panels do not have batteries, so any power generated that isn’t used at the home or business is sold back to the utility for purchase later.
At Synergy Power, we offer our customers a turnkey solution that addresses every aspect of going solar. We cover everything including finding the best solar system solution for your home or business, solar panel installation or solar roof tile installation, and the installation and maintenance of your system.

We know that solar systems are an upgrade to your home. According to one study by Lawrence Berkley National Labs, a solar energy system will increase the value of your home by at least $15,000.

Also, each kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar that your home or business generates substantially reduces greenhouse gas emissions like CO2, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particular matter and other dangerous pollutants while reducing water consumption and costly extraction methods necessitated by oil, gas and fracking solutions.

Just one hour of noon-time summer sun equals the annual United States’ electricity demand.

A roof assessment that tells us how much roof area is available for PV solar panels and how much sun they will get on an average basis.
A production estimate that estimates how much power the solar panels should produce in kilowatt hours (kWh) per year.
The make and model of equipment being proposed. A solar energy installation consists of panels, racks to attach the panels to your roof, and an inverter to change DC (direct current) power from the panels to AC (alternating current) that runs household appliances. The quote includes the make, model, and number of each component being proposed.
Solar installation costs are quoted in dollars-per-watt with average costs ranging between $3.50 and $4.50 per watt. System costs depend on several factors, including the size of the installation and the condition of your roof. Note that the installation size is measured in kilowatts (kW), which means, for example, that a 5-kW system at $3.80 / watt would have a total cost of $15,000.00
Available incentives – Get solar now before the Federal tax credit(ITC, Investment Tax Credit) is gone.
A payback estimate that uses the production estimate, incentives, and estimated electricity savings to give you a break-even point (4-5 years for businesses and 7 years for homeowners) along with how much you will save over the life of the panels.

Roof type: Asphalt shingles – tile and rubber membrane do not cost extra, but shake, slate or 100-year-old clay tile may make solar panel installation a bit more expensive.
Roof age: 5 to 10 years old is ideal. Once the solar panel installers have placed the solar tiles on top of the roof, they will last a long, long time. Therefore, a solar system installation is often combined with a new roof. We work with a number of roofers, which makes going solar and getting a new roof very easy.
Roof orientation: Due south is great, as is a western orientation, but anywhere between east-southeast and west is satisfactory. We are even seeing panels placed north on a roof. While you may face a slight loss in energy compared to other directions, it’s still better than renting from the utility. We can provide detailed analysis for every roof location.
Roof shade: You are looking for none at all, or very little. Shade kills the output of solar panels if they are traditionally wired, as shade on even a small portion of one panel can reduce output of a whole string of panels. We use micro inverters or optimizers on all our systems to overcome shade challenges. SolarEdge, one of our main product suppliers, is 99% CEC (California Energy Commission) rated efficient. This greatly helps any shading your roof may have. Winter and morning shade is not really as large as a concern as summer shade. Get a detailed analysis of your home solar today.

Over much of the last decade, California has led the way in the remarkable growth of the US solar market with PV 16,200 megawatts of installed solar power as of October 31, 2017.

As of mid-2017, the average price for solar panels for companies and homes in Oakdale was $3.85 per watt, compared to $9.00 in 2004. The typical residential system size in the United States is 5 kilowatts (5,000 watts), making the average cost of a solar energy system in Oakdale around $17,300 before any rebates or incentives, which impact the Return on Investment (ROI) over the life of your system.
In fact, the average solar panel system in Oakdale cost around $12,000 in 2017, after rebates and before factoring in ROI incentives. This is, in part, due to the 30% rebate offered to both residential and commercial installations. These costs can seem scary when you don’t compare them to what the utility company is charging. Many homeowners are lulled into paying a monthly bill and not realize they have nothing to show for it. Going solar replaces the utility bill and puts money into your home.

It is small, and generally produces about 1 to 2 watts of power.  These cells are connected to form larger units that are then connected to an electrical grid to form complete photovoltaic systems. Because solar energy systems are modular, they can be built to meet both large and small electric power needs. Made of different semiconductor materials, PV cells come in many sizes and shapes ranging from smaller than a postage stamp, to several inches in width. To withstand outdoor elements for many years, these cells are sandwiched between protective materials. PV modules and arrays are part of a larger system that includes mounting structures and components that convert direct current (DC) electricity to alternating current (AC) current, powering the electrical needs of your home or business. As a turnkey designer and installer of PV solar panels, Synergy Power ensures that all your solar energy system needs are taken care of for your solar panel roof installation, solar panel maintenance, and solar panel repair.

                                'content' => 'There are numerous benefits to hiring solar energy companies to power your home. These benefits include:

Financial Savings: Regardless of changing political stances, the fact is that growing global demand for solar power panels has spurred manufacturing and supply chain updates that have seen the cost of solar power drop significantly in many parts of the United States. Another incentive is that solar systems add as much as 20% in value to your home. This will increase as conventional electrical rates continue to escalate because solar systems stabilize your utility costs.
Sustainability: Solar energy is generated from the sun and is renewable. In addition, solar energy does not require water to operate, which means it does not have a significant impact on water systems the way that fossil fuels do.
Security: Solar-powered systems are less prone to large-scale failure or blackouts since a disruption of a system in one place does not cut off power to an entire region. In fact, a solar energy system is inherently secure when combined with micro-grids.
Job Creation: According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, “in 2011 the US solar industry employed approximately 100,000 people either full or part time.” This number topped over 300,000 in 2017 with close to 78% of jobs associated with solar energy systems being in installation, sales, and project development, while 15% are in manufacturing. This upward trend has been interrupted in 2018 by the imposition of tariffs on solar-related items coming into the United States but that is seen as only temporary.
Peak Power: Usage has been causing brownouts and blackouts in certain parts of the country when power cycles fluctuate, and demand and supply do not match. Traditional solar panels do not have batteries, so any power generated that isn’t used at the home or business is sold back to the utility for purchase later.
At Synergy Power, we offer our customers a turnkey solution that addresses every aspect of going solar. We cover everything including finding the best solar energy system solution for your home or business, solar panel installation or solar roof tile installation, and the installation and maintenance of your system. We know that solar panel systems are an upgrade to your home. According to one study by Lawrence Berkley National Labs, solar panel installation will increase the value of your home by at least $15,000. Also, each kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar that your home or business generates substantially reduces greenhouse gas emissions like CO2, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particular matter and other dangerous pollutants while reducing water consumption and costly extraction methods necessitated by oil, gas and fracking solutions. Just one hour of noon-time summer sun equals the annual United States’ electricity demand.

                                'content' => 'Making the decision to switch your San Jose home over to solar panels might seem like a difficult choice at first. After all, it is a major project, you are going away from what you and your family have used your entire life, and you probably are not sure exactly what solar panel companies are trying to sell you. However, there are major benefits in making the switch.

The first of which is the financial savings you are likely to receive. Solar panel sales reached 17-billion-dollars in 2017. More and more people are starting to see that it doesn’t matter what the political climate might be, the cost of solar power is dropping in many areas of the United States, particularly in California. Couple this with the fact that adding solar panels can increase your home’s value by 20%, and you are seeing a gigantic financial return on your investment.

Solar panels are a much more efficient way to power your home. One of our most common models is the LG365. This is a highly efficient module, at 21% panel efficiency, are able to eliminate that bill on small roofs with very little space. This leads to less power you need to buy from the utility, and more money in your pocket.

Another benefit to keep in mind is the sustainability aspect of solar roof tiles for your San Jose home. The more that we continue to rely upon fossil fuels, the more we are depleting the world of its natural resources. The sun is completely renewable energy. And living in an area like San Jose, there are plenty of sunny days throughout the year. Furthermore, while fossil fuels require water to operate, solar energy does not. This means that you will not significantly impact your local water system the way you would without solar panels.

Lastly, making the choice to go with solar panels with storage can greatly increase security in your home. When a blackout occurs, there is usually a disruption to one part of the entire system. However, this disruption will shut down the entire grid, causing everyone connected to the grid to lose power. This is not the case when there are solar panels and storage installed in your home, especially when they are combined with micro-grids.

                                'content' => 'Solar panels are best installed on rooftops. Rooftops not only present an unimpeded surface to the sun, which in San Jose is plentiful but also help angle the panels for peak performance. The simpler and less cluttered the roof the better. The presence of dormers and skylights can restrict your options. These solar roof panels are mounted on aluminum racks facing in a south or south-westerly direction.

The cost of solar panel installation includes not only the equipment and labor, but also other factors. You pay a fee to connect your system to the power grid, and there may be other permits to file. The design of the system will depend on the architecture of your house and the size of your grounds. Size and number of rooms will also influence the power output needed.

The good news is that solar panels are designed to last between 25 and 30 years. Even after that period, they will not stop generating electricity altogether, but it will decline gradually. It is not unusual for solar panels to still be generating up to 80% of their power output after 30 years. However, if you find yourself in need of solar panel repair, our team can help with that as well.

Trees around your property can prove to be a problem, shedding leaves and creating shade at various times of the day. This can lower the panels’ power output.

To clean your panels, use a soft soap and squeegee; never use an abrasive detergent. It is a good idea to install a monitoring system to track power output and performance. This way you know when it is time to clean off the layer of pollen and grime which accumulates. Synergy Power performs solar panel maintenance throughout the San Jose area.

A roof assessment that tells us how much roof area is available for PV solar roof panels and how much sun they will get on an average basis.
A production estimate that estimates how much power the solar roof tiles should produce in kilowatt hours (kWh) per year.
The make and model of equipment being proposed. A solar installation consists of solar panels, racks to attach the panels to your roof, and an inverter to change DC (direct current) power from the panels to AC (alternating current) that runs household appliances. The quote includes the make, model, and number of each component being proposed.
Solar installation costs are quoted in dollars-per-watt with average costs ranging between $2.50 and $4.50 per watt. System costs depend on several factors, including the size of the solar panel installation, and the condition of your roof. Note that the installation size is measured in kilowatts (kW), which means, for example, that a 5-kW system at $3.00 / watt would have a total cost of $15,000.00
Available incentives from both the state of California and the federal government, as well as your utility company incentives.
A payback estimate that uses the production estimate, incentives, and estimated electricity savings to give you a break-even point along with how much you will save over the life of the panels.
