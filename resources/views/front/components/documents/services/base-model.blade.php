	<h1>Laravel CMS -  How to use base model service</h1>
	<p>How to write your models in cms-laravel <br>to see how whole project will run with just one <b>array</b> in your model <br>and try to find out why this cms can help to develop more <b>easier</b> and <b>faster</b>.</p>
	<img src="{{ $page->image }}">
</div>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>You want to define columns in model, then develop them in your migrations file, and your forms and all part of your project.<br> When you want to change any column you should search through all your codes and its disgusting,<br> So just define an array about what columns you want in database, forms and table then change it just one time in your model ;)</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>In models we have a $columns array and project is running based on its items, for example we have:
<pre>
class User extends Authenticatable
{
	public $columns = [
	[
	    'name' => 'first_name',
	    'type' => 'string',
	    'database' => 'nullable',
	    'rule' => 'required|max:100',
	    'help' => 'Write your first name',
	    'form_type' => 'text',
	    'table' => true,
	],
</pre>
<p>$column['name']: is used for name of column in database and name of input in form. also it's used in factory for generating fake data.</p>
<p>$column['type']: defines column type in database also its used in factory. check <a target="blank" href="//github.com/faridsh69/cms/blob/master/app/Services/BaseFactory.php"> BaseFactory.php</a>.</p>
<p>$column['database']: is using in database migration function forexample nullable, default, usigned. check <a target="blank" href="//github.com/faridsh69/cms/blob/master/app/Services/BaseMigration.php"> BaseMigration.php</a>.</p>
<p>$column['rule']: is using in forms validation <a target="blank" href="//github.com/faridsh69/cms/blob/master/app/Services/BaseForm.php"> BaseForm.php</a>.</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>The most important part in development is storing data in database and editing them.<br>
With Laravel cms you dont have to develop any repeated and extra codes for getting to this aim, just you have to define your models and tell cms that what type of input you want!</p>
